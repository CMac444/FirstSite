Marsh & Associates, LLC is dedicated to efforts that promote conservation, recovery, and public education in behalf of the community of imperiled native fishes of the desert southwest.  This legacy of conservation was pioneered at Arizona State University beginning in the 1960â€™s by the late W. L. Minckley, the preeminent authority on this diverse group of indigenous fishes.  A long-time colleague of Professor Minckley, Dr. Paul C. Marsh continues these efforts with Dr. Thomas E. Dowling, ASU Professor of Conservation Genetics, in collaboration with state and federal resource agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.
