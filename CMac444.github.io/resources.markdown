Marsh & Associates provides access to resources that it has developed and maintained through cooperation and funding from federal, state, and non-government agencies for the benefit of the natural resources of the Southwest. These resources are provided free of charge in the hope that they will be utilized by conservation biologists and management entities to guide research and management decisions. This growing list of resources is part of our promise to not only provide sound science to our customers, but provide opportunities for all cooperators to continue to expand their knowledge and contribute to the conservation of wildlife.

Simple PIT tag searches are provided for all individuals through the search page of the The Lower Colorado River Native Fish Database.
